Build the extension from source
Please follow this document to build the extension package.
We are planning to automatically publish this extension by GitHub action, once finished, this step is not necessary.</description></item><item><title>WAMR fast interpreter introduction</title><link>https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wamr.dev/blog/wamr-fast-interpreter-introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 19:15:51 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wamr.dev/blog/wamr-fast-interpreter-introduction/</guid><description> A fast WebAssembly Interpreter design in WASM-Micro-Runtime In this paper, we introduced wasm-micro-runtime (abbreviated WAMR) fast-interpreter, in which several optimization methods are applied including fast bytecode dispatching, bytecode fusion, etc. Experiments show that the performance can be improved by ~150% on CoreMark compared with the classic stack-based interpreter. www.intel.com</description></item><item><title>WAMR source debugging basic</title><link>https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wamr.dev/blog/wamr-source-debugging-basic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 14:23:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wamr.dev/blog/wamr-source-debugging-basic/</guid><description>Image from https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/the-state-of-debugging-in-webassembly/ Table Of Contents Background Setup Debugging with CLI Remote debugging Issue with evaluation feature FAQ Background # Debugging takes a great part in application development, debuggers provide the capability to inspect the internal state of the execution programs, which make it easier to let the program work properly. It is hard to imagine a programming world without debugger.
Luckily, WAMR has supported source debugging feature based on lldb, and now is ready for use.</description></item></channel></rss>
